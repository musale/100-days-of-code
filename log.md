### Day 6: January 17th, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Day 3 on react JS tutorial.

**Thoughts:** we went through ```stateless functional components```, ```proptypes``` which help in de-bugging and documentation and we also did separating componente i.e. ```container components``` from ```presentational components```. I think following a 'programming structure' where by you abstract your program's functionality like this would be a great way to come up with clean, refactored and easy to maintain code.
